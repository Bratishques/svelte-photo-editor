## Svetle Image Editor

Just a practice project I made first time using Svetle, it is already deployed to http://wasteful-steam.surge.sh/

To run on your local machine clone the repo, install all npm modules and run by typing
`npm run dev`

### Plans

1. Typescriptize
2. Add clip-path option for more advanced shapes
3. Turn it into mini-photoshop
4. Make the system more reusable and modular
